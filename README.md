# hello-world
The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new.
I am guy, 18, trying to learn some of the basics of computer science to see if I want to continue and learn it at a university, so I needed to make a github account and basically follow the hello world tutorial to understand what github is and how it works.
